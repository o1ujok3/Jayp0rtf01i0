            Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Olujoke Fakoya and I am a
            web-developer. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            various frameworks such as React and Node. I am passionate about
            creating responsive and user-friendly websites. Do get in touch in
            you have any enquiries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a degree in Public Health and have been working in the
            industry for 5 years. I am currently undergoing a career-switch into
            tech and have worked on a variety of projects including e-commerce
            websites, web-applications and mobile apps. I am always looking to
            improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking, creating music and photography.

                Recipedia is a recipe search application which allows users to
                input an ingredient or dish name to return results. The results
                return recipe cards which include links to the full recipe.
                Users are also given the option of finding a local restaurant by
                clicking on the 'find a restaurant' button which then displays a
                list of resturants and their addresses. This application is a
                group project which has been created by students of the Trilogy
                front end web development bootcamp. This project has been
                developed using bootstrap, jQuery and two third party APIs as
                required by the project guidelines.

                This was a web application that I built for an assignment. The
                application allows users to search for volunteer opportunities
                and sign up for events. It also includes an admin portal for the
                organization to manage their events and volunteer information.

              <p>
                A password generator website which generates random, secure
                passwords for users. The website typically includes options for
                users to specify the length and complexity of the password, as
                well as any specific characters or symbols they would like to
                include. Once the user has selected their preferences, the
                website will generate a password that meets those criteria. Some
                password generator websites also have the option for users to
                store their generated passwords in a secure, encrypted format.

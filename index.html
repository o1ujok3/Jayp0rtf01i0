        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Olujoke Fakoya and I am a
          web-developer. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various
          frameworks such as React and Node. I am passionate about creating
          responsive and user-friendly websites. Do get in touch in you have any
          enquiries.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have a degree in Public Health and have been working in the industry
          for 5 years. I am currently undergoing a career-switch into tech and
          have worked on a variety of projects including e-commerce websites,
          web-applications and mobile apps. I am always looking to improve my
          skills and stay up to date with the latest technologies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, creating music and photography.</p>

              Recipedia is a recipe search application which allows users to
              input an ingredient or dish name to return results. The results
              return recipe cards which include links to the full recipe. Users
              are also given the option of finding a local restaurant by
              clicking on the 'find a restaurant' button which then displays a
              list of resturants and their addresses. This application is a
              group project which has been created by students of the Trilogy
              front end web development bootcamp. This project has been
              developed using bootstrap, jQuery and two third party APIs as
              required by the project guidelines.

              This was a web application that I built for an assignment. The
              application allows users to search for volunteer opportunities and
              sign up for events. It also includes an admin portal for the
              organization to manage their events and volunteer information.
